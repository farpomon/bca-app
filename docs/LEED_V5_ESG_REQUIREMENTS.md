# LEED v5 ESG Requirements Summary

## Key Carbon Metrics from LEED v5 BD+C Rating System

### 1. GHG Emissions & Global Warming Potential (GWP)

LEED v5 focuses on three main carbon categories:

**Operational Carbon:**
- Energy consumption tracking (kWh, therms)
- GHG emissions from building operations
- Grid carbon intensity considerations
- Refrigerant management (GWP benchmarks: 1400 for heat pumps, 700 for HVAC, 300 for process refrigeration)

**Embodied Carbon:**
- Whole-building life-cycle assessment (WBLCA)
- Modules A-C (cradle-to-grave, excluding operating energy)
- GWP measured in kg CO₂e
- Points awarded for 10-50%+ reduction in GWP

**Construction Carbon:**
- Track fuel and utility usage for contractor/subcontractor operations
- LCA Module A5 tracking

### 2. Building Performance Factors by Climate Zone

LEED v5 provides Building Performance Factors (BPFs) by building type and ASHRAE climate zone (0A-8):

| Building Type | Climate Zone Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Multifamily | 0.53-0.74 |
| Healthcare | 0.62-0.79 |
| Hotel/Motel | 0.56-0.72 |
| Office | 0.45-0.72 |
| Restaurant | 0.57-0.77 |
| Retail | 0.36-0.60 |
| School | 0.44-0.58 |
| Warehouse | 0.17-0.44 |

### 3. Embodied Carbon Reduction Points

| Reduction Level | Points (New Construction) | Points (Core & Shell) |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Meet baseline | 2 | 2 |
| 10% reduction | 3 | 3 |
| 20% reduction | 4 | 4 |
| 30% reduction | 5 | 5 |
| 40%+ reduction | 6 | 6-7 |
| 50%+ reduction | - | 7 |

### 4. WBLCA Impact Categories

Required impact categories for whole-building life-cycle assessment:
- Global Warming Potential (GWP) - kg CO₂e
- Ozone Depletion Potential - kg CFC-11e
- Acidification - moles H⁺ or kg SO₂e
- Eutrophication - kg N equivalent or kg phosphate equivalent
- Tropospheric Ozone Formation - kg NOx, kg O₃e, or kg ethene
- Depletion of Nonrenewable Energy Resources - MJ

### 5. Refrigerant GWP Benchmarks

| GWP Benchmark | Equipment Type |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1,400 | Heat pump service hot water heaters |
| 700 | HVAC, data centers, computer room AC |
| 300 | Process refrigeration, retail, cold storage |

### 6. ASHRAE Standards Reference

- ASHRAE 90.1-2019 (projects before Jan 1, 2028)
- ASHRAE 90.1-2022 (projects on/after Jan 1, 2028)
- Site-to-source energy conversion factor: 2.0 for electric

### 7. Canadian Grid Carbon Intensity Data

For Canadian projects, grid carbon intensity varies by province:
- Alberta: ~540 g CO₂e/kWh (coal-heavy)
- Ontario: ~40 g CO₂e/kWh (nuclear/hydro)
- Quebec: ~2 g CO₂e/kWh (hydro-dominant)
- British Columbia: ~11 g CO₂e/kWh (hydro-dominant)
- Saskatchewan: ~650 g CO₂e/kWh (coal-heavy)
- Manitoba: ~3 g CO₂e/kWh (hydro-dominant)

### 8. Implementation Priorities for BCA App

1. **GHG Emissions Tracking**
   - Scope 1: Direct emissions (on-site fuel combustion, refrigerants)
   - Scope 2: Indirect emissions (purchased electricity, heating/cooling)
   - Scope 3: Other indirect (materials, construction, transportation)

2. **Grid Carbon Intensity**
   - Province/region-specific emission factors
   - Time-of-use carbon intensity (marginal vs average)
   - Future grid decarbonization projections

3. **Embodied Carbon**
   - Material-level GWP tracking (kg CO₂e/unit)
   - Whole-building LCA support
   - EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) integration
   - Baseline comparison calculations

4. **LEED v5 Credit Tracking**
   - Prerequisites (EAp1-EAp3, MRp1)
   - Credits with point calculations
   - Certification level thresholds (40/50/60/80 points)
