# UI/UX Audit - Building Condition Assessment System

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Clean, professional layout with good use of white space
- Consistent card-based design pattern
- Clear information hierarchy in project cards
- Responsive grid layout
- Good use of icons for visual clarity

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Visual Hierarchy & Typography
- **Issue**: Stats cards have weak visual hierarchy - numbers and labels have similar weight
- **Issue**: Project cards lack visual distinction between primary and secondary information
- **Issue**: Typography scale could be more dynamic and expressive
- **Solution**: Enhance font sizes, weights, and spacing to create clearer hierarchy

#### 2. Color & Visual Appeal
- **Issue**: Monotone color scheme lacks visual interest
- **Issue**: "Draft" badges are gray and blend in - should be more prominent
- **Issue**: Stats cards lack color differentiation
- **Issue**: Project icons are all the same blue - no visual categorization
- **Solution**: Introduce accent colors, status-based color coding, and visual variety

#### 3. Component Design
- **Issue**: Stats cards are plain - could benefit from subtle gradients or visual elements
- **Issue**: Project cards have inconsistent information density
- **Issue**: "New Project" button could be more prominent
- **Issue**: Empty states and loading states need enhancement
- **Solution**: Add visual polish, improve button hierarchy, enhance interactive states

#### 4. Spacing & Layout
- **Issue**: Some elements feel cramped (card content)
- **Issue**: Grid gaps could be more generous
- **Issue**: Page padding could be optimized for different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Refine spacing system for better breathing room

#### 5. Micro-interactions
- **Issue**: No hover states or transitions visible
- **Issue**: Cards could have subtle elevation changes on hover
- **Issue**: Buttons lack interactive feedback
- **Solution**: Add smooth transitions, hover effects, and visual feedback

#### 6. Dashboard Components
- **Issue**: FCI gauge and charts need visual polish
- **Issue**: Condition matrix could use better color coding
- **Issue**: Financial planning table needs better visual hierarchy
- **Solution**: Enhance data visualization aesthetics
