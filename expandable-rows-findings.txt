Expandable Category Rows Feature - Implementation Complete

The feature has been successfully implemented. When clicking on a category row (e.g., "G - Site"), 
it expands to show the component assessments within that category.

Observed behavior:
1. G - Site category (5 components, $432K repair cost, $1.37M replacement value, 31.5% FCI) expands to show:
   - G4010 Electrical Distribution - Poor condition - $155K repair - $323K replacement - 1 yrs RUL
   - G3030 Storm Sewer - Poor condition - $96K repair - $281K replacement - 7 yrs RUL
   - G2040 Site Development - Fair condition - $94K repair - $496K replacement - 13 yrs RUL
   - G2050 Landscaping - Poor condition - $79K repair - $157K replacement - 5 yrs RUL
   - G4030 Site Communications & Security - Good condition - $8K repair - $113K replacement - 44 yrs RUL

2. Other categories remain collapsed but can be expanded:
   - D - Services (MEP) - 1 component - $200K - $488K - 41.0%
   - C - Interiors - 2 components - $167K - $620K - 27.0%
   - E - Equipment & Furnishings - 2 components - $167K - $637K - 26.2%

3. Total row shows: 10 components, $966K repair cost, $28.65M replacement value, 3.4% FCI

The implementation includes:
- Chevron icons (> for collapsed, v for expanded)
- Colored dots matching the category color
- Component code prefix (e.g., G4010, G3030)
- Condition status badges (Poor, Fair, Good)
- Repair cost, replacement value, and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) columns
- Indented component rows for visual hierarchy
